# Welcome to marvin
Marvin is a smart home automation system.  The official hardware device is the Sonoff by itead.  The firmware running on them is the awesome "Sonoff MQTT OTA Arduino" by arendst [here](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-MQTT-OTA-Arduino).  To sum it up, that firmware supports OTA updates, uses the arduino IDE and fully supports MQTT!  The backend will be written in python (flask) and the frontend will be done using react.

# Features
The end goal of Marvin is to "automate everything".  I would love to never have to touch a light switch again.  To do this, marvin will eventually have the following features:
* A slick (mobile friendly) web app that allows full control.
* A bunch of auto controls like timers and sensors.
* Google Now integration for voice commands.
* Be plug and play so anyone can use Marvin.

# Contributing
Unfortuneately we're still trying to get everything off the ground so we aren't looking for contributors yet.  However, if you *really* want to help out send me a message to [admin@jabelone.com](mailto:admin@jabelone.com).
